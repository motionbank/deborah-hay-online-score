	<p class="c10 c2"><span>What if dance is how I practice my relationship with my whole body at once in relationship to the space where I am dancing in relationship to each passing moment in relationship to my audience? What if the depth of this question is on the surface?</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c10 c2"><span>What if my choice to surrender the pattern, and it is just a pattern, of facing a single direction or fixing on a singularly coherent idea, feeling, or object when I am dancing is a way of remembering to see where I am in order to </span><span class="c7">dis-attach</span><span class="c19 c7">1</span><span>&nbsp;where I am? </span></p>
	<p></p>

<div class="scene" data-title="fred + ginger">
	<p>[There is no text that accompanies this part of the solo.]</p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="the beginning">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;appear at the edge of the stage as the last few audience members take their seats. My behavior is matter-of-fact. I have a lot of choices to make in advance of my entrance. I decide on my entrance site and the direction I will travel in relation to the audience, plus where that path will end. Then the light fades.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="curved path">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment the light returns I step onto the stage, walking in a stride and style not mine, as foreign as a foreign accent, recognizable but odd. The path is a singular broad curve that ends in a slightly accelerated little curl, leaving me facing the portal through which I stepped onto the stage.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c12 c23">Note: Nothing about my performance ends at the end of the curl.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="link to portal">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am held by an imagined cord linking me to the portal. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I attend to the exactness of the single broad curve so that when I face my entrance site it is as if I complete the stringing of an archer&rsquo;s bow.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c23 c1 c12">Note: I deliberately create this space within a space, separating me from the audience.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">An ancient voice quietly advises me to remember the audience as well as the space beyond my tightly contained space. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1 c12">Note: The ancient voice is me from 10,000 years ago bringing that possibility into the present.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1 c12">Note: My choice to perform this material requires catastrophic acts of perception. I associate catastrophic with images of great loss. The magnitude and reoccurrence of choreographed behavior that I need to first recognize and then dis-attach from, again and again, is a personal loss of tremendous proportion. </span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="break cord and second beginning">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">In response to the guidance received, I select the right moment to break the string and notice at once how the inclusion of the theater and my audience enlarges my dancing. It is like a real opening, and I begin again.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="joy + sorrow">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c1">My body is still while joy and sorrow wash across my face like a stream of instances. When not streaming, my face may briefly return to normalcy, or it may sustain a single reflection of joy/sorrow for longer moments. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">Note: I am not limited to my personal experience of joy and sorrow. It is a relief to know that it is in and about the audience, this theater, and the world beyond its doors.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c23 c1 c12">Note: As I perform, I try to remove my tendency to embody the images I use to describe the movement material.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="wordless song">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">I sing a wordless song that arises from and combines joy and sorrow into a single melody that resonates through my bones. Barely suppressing a sense of personal history, my face reflects the transience of joy and sorrow.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I hear the song as my voice leaves my body. I am intentionally unguarded because I rarely allow myself to partake in unprotected experiences. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I am not translating the written language into movement, i.e., joy and sorrow. I actually aspire toward a bodily speechlessness by noticing my visual field, which includes what I can and cannot see, as well as minute associative instances that rise spontaneously.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I understand that joy and sorrow are always present. I do not have to instigate them. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">The song&rsquo;s duration is determined by how much time is required for the song to impress itself on my body and the audience&rsquo;s memory. Its phrasing can expand and contract.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: Singing a song of joy and sorrow is a challengingly simple way for me to engage my perception of space and time. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I attach rhythmic movement to the song, my dancing obviously influenced by my singing. I establish this continuity of relationship before using it to navigate a slightly complex path to the edge of the stage. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I strongly maintain the role of the choreographer, overseeing the particularity of the path I travel and making spatial choices without becoming too artistic.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Partway, my audible singing disappears, yet the dancing adheres to its reliance on the now unheard rhythm of the song. </span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="hidden diagonal">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">And finally my dance shifts outside of the prevailing memory of the song, and I move across stage in a straight line while erasing my destination. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: While dancing I make an effort not to hesitate. Learned behavior suggests I slow down or listen more in order to get things right. That is a belief that limits my dance.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="1 minute turn">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">At the edge of the stage, with a 1-minute allotment to turn in place a single time without moving slowly or continuously, I perform the joy and sorrow in restraint and sing </span><span class="c4 c7 c1">snippets </span><span class="c4 c1">of the joy/sorrow song on 2 or 3 occasions during the turn. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: My head is free to look down or away or to turn. It is not fixed.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="work">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">If the sparsely singing turn is like a lock unlocking, then </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">work</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;is my deliverance into space after 1 minute. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I accept any movement that arises spontaneously and call it </span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">work</span><span class="c3 c1">. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">Work is a variation on a 2-part spontaneous movement used to cross stage one time. Work is also how I manage the choreographic tools I need to maintain both my interest and that of the audience. </span><span class="c4 c1">Those tools are the perception of my movement as music, my perception of space, the use of stillness and duration, and the perception of joy and sorrow to deepen my practice of performance. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: During this movement it is helpful to enlarge my perception of space beyond the theater.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: There is no repetition in live performance.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: </span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">Work</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;comes easily. Maybe it is because of what is required to survive as a dancer in contemporary western culture. It can be difficult to dis-attach from the habitual physical response to what &ldquo;work&rdquo; looks like, i.e., striving, reaching, pushing, dragging, busying, flailing, hauling.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I neither hurry nor linger.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="complexity">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">Complexity arises. I play with how I perceive time and how I perceive space rather than creating complex body movement. Clearing the dance of complexity is as abstruse, yet here I am, two alternating occurrences weaving back and forth. The duration of the two parts is choreographically challenging. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: The movement is not difficult just because I use the words </span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">complexity</span><span class="c3 c1">, havoc, abstruse, choreographically challenging. And </span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">clearing the dance of complexity</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;does not necessarily require flowing movement.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: If I can manage my perception of time and space to inform my body, then I do not have to think about what movement to do next. What I mean by my perception of time is that it is passing. And what I mean by my perception of space is that I include it in my dancing so that I am not seduced by the intelligence, past experiences, patterns, limitations, and/or sensuality of my moving body. &nbsp;</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="mall + object">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I perform market, a contemporary market, </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">a mall</span><span class="c4 c1">. Without creating </span><span class="c4 c1 c11">a mall</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;I notice it wherever I am. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I attend to my perception of space and time in order to distract myself from predetermining the outcome of this choreographic direction. It is an effort to refrain from creating a literal mall. Instead, copious instances of </span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">a mall</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;appear and disappear as I dance. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1 c7">A single object reveals itself in a mall. I perform several views of object for the benefit of the audience. A mall and object alternate their appearances. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I do not create</span><span class="c4 c13 c1 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">object</span><span class="c3 c1">. I learn its attributes from my body and actually take pleasure in identifying the object for myself in each performance.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I remember to notice that my whole body is producing unimaginable instances of specificity.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="particle">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I start spinning, not literally but as a part of an onstage counterclockwise spinning vortex that only I perceive. I am a speck, a dot, a flake, endlessly spiraling toward center stage, and absolutely no one can possibly identify me as such.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: The movement may change, but the choreography itself does not change.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="holy + indian">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">At center stage I reverse direction and turn in place while lifting my arms incrementally, to signify the construction and architecture of a holy site. At the same time my shoes lightly tap the floor under me as if to imply the sporadic </span><span class="c4 c7 c1 c12">thwacks</span><span class="c4 c7 c1">&nbsp;of a hammer, striking in the distance.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I am</span><span class="c4 c1 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">a holy site</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;and to perform as such requires the catastrophic loss of how I otherwise perceive myself.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c11 c4 c1">A holy site</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;is completed the moment my hands or fingers touch overhead. I open my mouth and hear </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">a holy song</span><span class="c4 c1 c21">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">rise up out of me. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1 c12">Note: I call what I hear a holy song and notice the feedback from my whole body as it yields to that direction.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Unable to sustain itself, </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">a holy site</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;collapses. My hands, still touching, drop before my eyes. I contemplate the symbolism of the gestural demise. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">Resourcing whatever bits of prior exposure to the American Indian ritual, I reproduce it as best as I can while rhythmlessly bouncing to beating drums that only I can hear. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">The American Indian ritual collapses. I rebuild a holy site, using the sound of my tapping feet as before. I travel in fading light.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="tiptoeing">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Light returns and I am tiptoeing, not wanting to disrupt the space already created &ndash; a task I hold in high regard. I experience space parting, with little to no disturbance, hoping that the audience will see this too, before arriving somewhere that is not center stage. My actions are obvious. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">When I imagine the stage is still, instantaneously perform my almost non-existent fake American Indian ritual dance which I may be the only person in the world to realize. Punctuated by beating drums that only I can hear I may bounce rhythmlessly with the supposed drums.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="beckett quote">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c1">I lift and point my right index finger in the air and, speaking in a Southern accent, say, &ldquo;Strictly speaking I believe I have never been anywhere.&rdquo; [Beckett] </span><span class="c19 c7 c1">2</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">With my finger still in the air, I leave time for the Beckett quote to sink in. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: The quote&rsquo;s impact on my body is mind-boggling.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: My finger can be a trap. I do not fixate on it &ndash; deliberately hiding its function in determining my movement.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="silly song and dance">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c7 c1">My right hand lowers as I hum &nbsp;&ldquo;The Snake Charmer&rsquo;s Song.&rdquo; My perception of joy and sorrow guides the singing. The lifetime of the song is how long it takes for my hand to lower. My standard for &ldquo;lower&rdquo; is my own. </span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="market + traditional object">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I am unquantifiable instances of a </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">5,000-year-old marketplace</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;before sunrise, while it is still dark and quiet. I depend on the image at first, and then I get rid of it. This is not a narrative. Maybe a wind moves the air around a makeshift pole, flap, cover, knot, uneven surface. My hand occasionally thrums my body for sound, or I make short intermittent sounds that are barely audible.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: It is an effort to refrain from creating a marketplace. Instead, copious instances of predawn marketplace live and die spontaneously. It is all I need. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">It is the same for a single item, like a particular utensil, crafted tool, or ornament &ndash; an untraditional object in a 5,000-year-old marketplace. There is no name for the item, fortunately. I provide several views of an untraditional object for the audience.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1 c12">Note: I am not translating the written language into movement, i.e., utensil, crafted tool, marketplace. I actually aspire toward a bodily speechlessness so that I can notice and appreciate the abundance of materiality that can surface momentarily.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="counterintuitive travel">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I perform counterintuitive travel somewhere at the edge of the space.</span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">A cranky voice provides continuous accompaniment. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1 c12">Note: The term &ldquo;counterintuitive travel&rdquo; is what it is &ndash; another way. Counterintuitive reflects possibility, not intention, psychology, or effort.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I do not become cranky. Cranky describes my voice.</span></p>

	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: Accepting any movement, I call it </span><span class="c11 c4 c1 c12">mend</span><span class="c3 c1">. At the same time it is an effort not to automatically produce comforting arm or hand movements or behave like a mother hen. </span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="road">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I build a road with my feet used to smooth and design its surface. My work is clear and evident, without rest. I make a rhythmic sound, like an engine, to create a counterpart to the work of building the road. My arms, held out from my body, symbolize the shape of the engine.</span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c3 c1">Note: I strongly maintain the role of the choreographer, overseeing the design element of the road. I think of the road&rsquo;s surface as a mosaic, without getting too artistic. </span></p>
</div>

<div class="scene" data-title="holy site + song">
	
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I turn and turn and turn, as many times as I remain interested in turning on this big new road, bringing separate parts together in a whirling whole that becomes </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">a holy site</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c7 c1">somewhere on stage</span><span class="c4 c1">. The turning is happening in my perception of the whole stage, and my body is just a part of it. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">My arms are above my head, and they function as the architecture of the temple, shrine, church, mosque, etc. My hands, like antenna, draw </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">a holy song</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;down through </span><span class="c11 c4 c1">a holy site</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;and out through my mouth. It does not have to be anything other than holy &ndash; holy being different for everyone. </span></p>
	<p></p>
	<p class="c0"><span class="c4 c7 c1">My arms collapse, poised like a mound of rubble in front of me. Holding my body still, I step toward the audience to offer them several views of the former holy site. </span></p>
